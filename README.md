# Vectorious
This repository contains a library for Vector and Matrix algebra, written in TypeScript.

At the moment, basic operations on Vectors and Matrices are supported, like:
- Addition, subtraction
- Multiplication (scaling, dot product, matrix-vector multiplication)

This tiny library is not meant to encompass the entirety of Linear Algebra, so operations like reducing and inverting matrices will most likely not be supported.
